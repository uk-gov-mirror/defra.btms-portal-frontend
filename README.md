## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v24`
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v10.5.1` (installed with Node.js)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

You may find it easier to manage Node.js versions using a version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n). From within the project folder you can then either run `nvm use` or `n auto` to install the required version.

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Authentication

For local authentication, we use the [cdp-defra-id-stub](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-defra-id-stub). If you run this as within Docker you will also get an instance of Redis, which can be used for session caching. You should also delete the [reference to localstack](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-defra-id-stub/blob/main/compose.yml#L20-L21) within the stubs `compose.yml` file.

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Environment variables

For local development some environment variables can to be added to a `.env.local` file at the root of the project, (this will be ignored by Git). These will then be picked up by Convict in [src/config/config.js](src/config/config.js) when you start the app using `npm run dev`

#### Variables needed for local development

Ask a member of the team to provide you with values.

### Formatting

#### Windows Prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Server-side caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for
local development. You can override the default behaviour by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or `memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services access Redis keys that are namespaced using the service name (e.g. `my-service:*`).

If your service does not require a session cache to be shared between instances or if you don't require Redis, you can
disable Redis be setting `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=memory`.
